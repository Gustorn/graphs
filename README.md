# graphs

Graph algorithms implemented in TypeScript using Immutable.JS for the graph's implementation. The following algorithms are implemented:

## Visitation

- breadth-first traversal
- depth-first traversal
- topological traversal

The library also includes two helper classes:

- `ReverseGraph`: flips the direction of the edges in a directed graph
- `UndirectedGraph`: transforms the directed graph into an undirected one

## Algorithms

- A*
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Weakly connected components
- Strongly connected components
    - Tarjan
    - Kosaraju
- Cycle detection
- Shortest path
- Topological sort
